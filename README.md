Light-on-dark color scheme, also called dark mode, is a supplemental mode that uses a color scheme in which content of a webpage is displayed on a dark background. Such a color scheme reduces the light emitted by screens and enhances readability. Switching to dark mode allows website users to move to an eye-friendly and resource-saving design whenever they want.
